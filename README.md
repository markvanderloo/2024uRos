# Tutorial on data validation with the `validate` R package

Materials for a two-hour tutorial on data validation with the `validate` package


### Preparation

Make sure you have a recent version of R installed. It is recommended, but not
strictly necessary to work with an IDE that integrates R (e.g. `vscode` or
`RStudio/Posit`).


Install the `validate` and `validatetools` packages from CRAN.

```r
install.packages(c('validate','validatetools'))
```
